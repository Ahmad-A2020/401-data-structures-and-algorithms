## Whiteboard Process
in this challenges, we created a plan for process of thinking to solve programming issue including descripe of the problem domain, drow chart to Visualized the problem, create Algorithm, write code draft (Pseudocode), and then write the code using the programming language and teat the result.

## Approach & Efficiency

the lab learned me new think straigy.
