### Code Challenge: Class 30: Hash Table Implementation:
in this challenge a hash code data structure were created a hash table which  is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. 
the hashCode class use hashNode class to generate a node holds the buckets (key,value). Besides that the class contains several methods as follws: 
- add: takes two arguments(key, value), and then hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes one argument(key), and returns the value associated with that key in the table
- contains: takes one argument(key), and returns true or false based on key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes one argument(key), and returns Index in the collection for that key.
